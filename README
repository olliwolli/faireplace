This script is an addition to FAI. It makes templating easier and allows central configuration management. To get a hold of configuration values which are not centralized in the FAI installation this script helps. The script allows changing configuration values for the installation clients and server like the used LDAP server, Mail server, syslog server and whatever you want centrally in just a few class based configuration files. This makes it easier to migrate one FAI configuration space from one environment to another and avoids errors.
